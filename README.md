# MyVector

I have tried to create my own vector header file. In this the programmer can create the vector and use its methods to play with the vector.


Steps to use MyVector.h :-

1. Clone the respository or download the zip file and extract it.
2. include the headerfile "MyVector.h" in program.
3. Create Vector Objects and use it's methods.


Available Vector Methods are :-


// Vector Methods //
1. push_in()
2. pop_out()
3. flush_vector()
4. show_elements()
5. sort()
6. is_element_exits()
7. get_length()
8. implement_binary_search()
9. get_element()
10. get_sum()
11. get_product()
12. get_max()
13. get_min()


// Operators that can be used with vector objects //
1. []     // used to get elements by specifying their index
2. +      // used to Concantenate two Vectors
3. +=     // used to Concantenate two Vectors
4. <      // used to Compare two Vectors
5. >      // used to Compare two Vectors
6. ==     // used to Compare two Vectors
7. !=     // used to Compare two Vectors
8. <=     // used to Compare two Vectors
9. >=     // used to Compare two Vectors
